Title: Preflight Quality Control for Panel and Long Time Series
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Ruiyi", "Yang", email = "yryrena@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides tools to scan, flag, and repair common data quality issues 
    in panel and long-format time series. Functions detect duplicates, gaps, 
    outliers, and structural breakpoints (via 'strucchange'), and compute 
    features such as stationarity tests and seasonal strength (via 'tseries', 
    'urca', and 'feasts'). Suggested fixes can be applied traceably, and results 
    can be exported to HTML reports (via 'quarto' or 'rmarkdown').
